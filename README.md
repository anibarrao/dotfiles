# Dotfiles 

Welcome, stranger, to this repository I have consigned my dotfiles for your pleasure, and make my life more easy. 

In this repository you will find the basic setup of how I do web Development. Within the `install.sh` script you will find the installation of basic tool for development in Mac; `Homebrew`, `git`, `Neovim`, and the most common programming languages; `go`, `c++`, `python`, etc. Also, you will find the installation of powerlevel10k to enhance zsh as your main sh interpreter on `iterm2` and `tmux` as the multiplexer.  

Also, you will find my personal aliases and the most common snippets.
